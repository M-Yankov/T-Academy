Task 1. Good Abstraction

    Take the VS solution Abstraction and refactor its code to provide good abstraction.
        Move the properties and methods from the class Figure to their correct place.
        Move the common methods to the base class's interface.
        Remove all duplicated code (properties / methods / other code).

Task 2. Good Encapsulation

    Establish good encapsulation in the classes from the VS solution Abstraction.
        Ensure that incorrect values cannot be assigned in the internal state of the classes.
Note from the student: I'm not agree with styleCop - "If the method parameters are on separate lines, the first parameter must begin on the line beneath the name of the method."
