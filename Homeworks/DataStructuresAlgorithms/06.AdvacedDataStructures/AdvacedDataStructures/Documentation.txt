The PriorityQueue is not fully implemented. And will not work correct if Dequeue then Enqueue the again Dequeue.
Instead just use already defined collections in C5 library or Wintellect Power Collections.

for Task3 - if you want 100MB File just copy-paste text there while(size < 100MB) or while(youDie ||laptopDie)

If something gets wrong on build program, add reference to the external libraries > PowerCollections.dll, Triepocaypse.dll
